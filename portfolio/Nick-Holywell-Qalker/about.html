				<p>Nick Holywell-Walker started playing music aged five on a dilapidated family piano, and had the tenacity to keep playing long after he had been asked to stop. After his grandma blew his mind by leaving gatefold red vinyl copy of the Beatles 62-66 lying around for him to discover, his obsession with record players, speakers and microphones started to germinate. Stereophonic sound had stolen his heart.</p>
						  <p>In his early teens he heard Kraftwerk and Depeche Mode which, along with the plundering of his oldest brother's vinyl collection for gems, inspired him to buy his first synthesiser, from the back pages of the NME.&nbsp;&nbsp; Self-funded forays into recording studios were regular in his teenage years, along with synth-driven live shows.&nbsp; Aged 18, he recorded his first full studio album, selling his VW beetle to pay the studio bill.</p>
						  <p>After apprenticing as a 'tape-op' in a small Suffolk studio, where artists such as Roger Eno and Hank Wangford would record, he moved to London in 1993 to become a full-time assistant engineer and synth programmer, catching the last days of analogue tape machines just as computers started to arrive as serious recording tools.</p>
							  <p>After &quot;staying awake for almost the entire of 1993&quot; in a legendary 24-hour studio on Holloway Road, called Vons, he joined highly influential UK band, Killing Joke, in 1994 for what was to become more than a decade of live shows and album projects around the globe.&nbsp; Encouraged by the band's frontman, Jaz Coleman, to study orchestration and world music after the two of them working on side projects with artists such as Natascha Atlas and Transglobal Underground, years of immersive self-study followed, and in 1998 Nick was introduced to London music production company, The Music Scultptors, kicking off by arranging the BAFTA award winning animated film &quot;The First Snow of Winter&quot; for the English Chamber Orchestra.</p>
							  <p>This began a long-term relationship with the ubiquitous Soho based team.&nbsp; Between 1998 and 2004 he was involved in more than 250 projects, from Feature films, Branding campaigns, TV Drama, Commercials and lots, lots more - an immersive and incredibly productive period that further developed Nick's love for his art, bringing with it another level of work-ethic and the adrenaline rush of multiple impending deadlines.</p>
							  <p>In 2004 he went on to form his own production company, bringing his talents to hundreds of branding, advertising and TV projects, including documentaries, and making a move into drama in 2016, initially alongside award winning UK composer Andy Price (Robin Hood, Law and Order) - fulfilling score production and mix duties on Discovery’s epic “Knightfall” series, The BBC’s award winning cult series “Wolfblood” on which he co-composed season 3 and solo composed Seasons 4 and 5.</p>
				  <p>Most recently, once again alongside Andy Price, Nick has co-written, score produced and mixed seasons 21, 22 and 23 of the BBC’s long running, forensic drama “Silent Witness”</p>
						  <p>Based in his beloved North London studio, Nick works in a wide range of music genres, his obsession with musical and sonic craftsmanship being a lifelong quest.</p>
